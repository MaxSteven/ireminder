This is a simple reminder tool using PyQt4.
Once it's ran, a window will show up that you can set a time for notification and a message to show up.
You also have an option to set the notification window to be closed 10 seconds after it opens, otherwise it'll stay open till yo close it.

Here are some images of the ui:
